Train-Test Split & Evaluation Metrics
 Internship Task

AI & ML Internship – Task 5

This task focuses on understanding model evaluation fundamentals using a supervised machine learning approach.

Objective

The main objective of this task is to:

Split a dataset into training and testing sets

Train a Logistic Regression model

Evaluate the model using Accuracy, Precision, Recall

Understand and interpret the Confusion Matrix

Dataset

Heart Disease Dataset

The dataset contains medical attributes such as:

Age

Sex

Cholesterol

Maximum heart rate

Other clinical features

Target variable indicating presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

 Steps Performed
1. Dataset Preparation

Created/loaded the heart disease dataset

Identified features and target variable

2. Train-Test Split

Dataset split into 80% training and 20% testing

Ensures unbiased evaluation of the model

3. Feature Scaling

Applied StandardScaler

Improves Logistic Regression performance

4. Model Training

Trained a Logistic Regression model on training data

5. Prediction

Predictions generated on unseen test data

6. Model Evaluation

The following metrics were calculated:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

Confusion Matrix

Evaluation Metrics Explained

Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model

Precision: How many predicted heart disease cases were actually correct

Recall: How many actual heart disease cases were correctly identified

Confusion Matrix:

True Positives (TP)

True Negatives (TN)

False Positives (FP)

False Negatives (FN)
